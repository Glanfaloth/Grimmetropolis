### About the game
The project is a tower defense game with co-op multiplayer capabilities. Each player will control a character in a 3D top-down game world. The players will start at a castle which they have to protect. The players have to collect resources in order to construct buildings. Buildings have mainly two purposes: They help you collect more resources or defend against the enemies. The enemies will constantly come to attack the castle, buildings or the players. They will sometimes attack in smaller groups or in bigger waves. In the course of the game, the enemies become stronger and stronger. Therefore, you need to upgrade buildings or train your character. This also requires more resources which can be accessed when you expand around you castle. Eventually, you will lose. The premise of this game is to find the best strategy to defend against the enemy as long as possible.

### How to play

Grimmetroplis is a co-op multiplayer tower defence game. You will be playing hand in hand in a team with other famous fairy tale characters (i.e. Snow White 👸🏻, Cinderella 👸🏼, Frog King 🐸, Booted Cat 🐱 and the Beast 🦁) to protect the magical artifact - a crown 👑 stored in the castle 🏰

Enemies 🧙🏻‍♀️ will come and try destroying the castle to steal the crown away. To fight against the enemies, you will need to collect different resources in order to construct buildings.

There are two major types of buildings:

- defensive buildings
    - outpost 🗼: shoots enemies in range. It consumes 1 food/s to upkeep
    - wall 🧱: blocks enemies’ path
- supportive buildings
    - resource collection building 🏡: automatically collects nearby resources
    - hospital 🏥: heals nearby players
    - farms 🌾: produces 4 food/s to sustain outposts

There are three types of resources:

- wood 🌳
- stone 🗻
- food (produced automatically by farms) 🥖

There are four kinds of items (tools and weapons)

- axe 🔪: collect wood resources
- pickaxe ⛏️ : collect stone resources
- hammer 🔨: repair and construct buildings
- sword 🗡️: increase damage when attacking enemies

The premise of this game is to find the best strategy to defend against the enemy as long as possible. Details about the gameplay will be covered by the interactive tutorials at the beginning of the game. If it is not your first time playing the game and you want to skip the tutorial session, just kill the tutorial guide at the beginning of the game. The game is designed to be played off-line and for the best user experience, it is recommended to play with an **xbox controller** 🎮 as the input device.
